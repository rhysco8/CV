After a year performing at an improvised comedy theatre in Amsterdam, I came back to London wanting a fresh challenge. I wanted something that would keep me stimulated and engaged on a daily basis. Be careful what you wish for! Coding is constantly surprising me, I'm finding out what programming languages can do and what I can't yet do constantly and I love it.

## Skills
