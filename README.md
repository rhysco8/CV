After a year performing at an improvised comedy theatre in Amsterdam, I came back to London wanting a fresh challenge. I wanted something that would keep me stimulated and engaged on a daily basis. Be careful what you wish for! Coding is constantly surprising me, I'm finding out what programming languages can do and what I can't yet do constantly and I love it.

## Skills

#### Growth Mindset - quick to learn

#### Development Process - BDD and TDD

I've used an outside-in approach to develop programs, writing feature tests and unit tests to drive development incrementally. I've worked with testing DSLs `RSpec`, `Jasmine`, `Jest`, `Capybara` and `XCTest` using the 'Red, Green, Refactor' process.

#### Pair Programming & XP Values

I've found pair programming a great way to work and paired with a lot of fantastic people in my cohort at Makers, communicating actively and with empathy. I've taken action when pairing hasn't gone so well, reflecting with my pair partner on what's not going so well and using that as an opportunity to give and receive actionable, specific and kind feedback, try new approaches and become a better pair partner - with great feedback from my pair partners!

> "You were very kind and patient"

> "I had a great time pairing with you"

> "You explained your ideas well"

#### Public Speaking

I'm comfortable and experienced speaking in public, whether it's to friends and family at the Makers final project presentation, or to nearly 2,000 people at the Carré theatre in Amsterdam. I have also delivered public speaking workshops for Accenture, giving pointers on best practices for delivering short presentations.

<!-- #### Thrive Under Pressure

Working at Boom Chicago, creating content on the fly + Would often involve managing staff levels between phone and showroom sales channels to offer the best customer experience. managing  a furniture showroom on a weekend bank holiday at sofa.com - turnover of £150k+ against a typical daily turnover of £30k.

#### Customer Service

Working in furniture retail.

#### Practical Problem Solver

Leading mob sessions during the Makers final project when the group was blocked, diagramming our app and breaking down how it should work. combining that with the what the group had researched to guide us through how to unblock ourselves and apply relevant, useful information
