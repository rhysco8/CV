I am a software engineer who excels under pressure and empowers teams to succeed through effective communication and collaboration. I want to work for a company that fosters a supportive learning environment, giving me the chance to try things and ~~fail~~ learn, where I can get a broad general understanding of all the tools used but specialising in a couple of areas.

## Skills

#### Growth Mindset - quick to learn

I take an organised approach to learning, setting SMART goals to structure and manage how I learn that allows me to take on new concepts and languages quickly. I was able to code a thermostat web app in `JavaScript` in a week without having used the language before.

#### Development Process - BDD and TDD

I've used an outside-in approach to develop programs, writing feature tests and unit tests to drive development incrementally. I've worked with testing DSLs `RSpec`, `Jasmine`, `Jest`, `Capybara` and `XCTest` using the 'Red, Green, Refactor' process.

#### Pair Programming & XP Values

I've found pair programming a great way to work and paired with a lot of fantastic people in my cohort at Makers, communicating actively and with empathy. I've taken action when pairing hasn't gone so well, reflecting with my pair partner on what's not going so well and using that as an opportunity to give and receive actionable, specific and kind feedback, try new approaches and become a better pair partner - with great feedback from my pair partners!

> "You were very kind and patient"

> "I had a great time pairing with you"

> "You explained your ideas well"

#### Public Speaking

I'm comfortable and experienced speaking in public, whether it's to friends and family at the Makers final project presentation, or to nearly 2,000 people at the Carr√© theatre in Amsterdam. I have also delivered public speaking workshops for Accenture, giving pointers on best practices for delivering short presentations.

## About Me

After a year performing at an improvised comedy theatre in Amsterdam, I came back to London wanting a fresh challenge. I wanted something that would keep me stimulated and engaged on a daily basis. Be careful what you wish for! Coding is constantly surprising me, I'm finding out what programming languages can do and what I can't yet do constantly and I love it. I want to keep honing my existing skills whilst learning new ones.

### Other interests

:performing_arts: Improv comedy. I perform with my troupe a couple of times a month in London and have performed with them at festivals in New York, Edinburgh, Dublin, Barcelona, Tallinn and Uppsala.

:closed_lock_with_key: Escape rooms. Nothing like solving puzzles under pressure as a team and we usually find time to fit one in when we're at an improv festival.

:soccer: Big fan of football, in particular Tottenham Hotspur. It's the hope that kills you.
