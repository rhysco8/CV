* Fairly admin and preparatory work heavy day today, finding out what to expect and getting as many ducks in a row as possible.
* Huntr looks really cool, should help a lot tracking job applications. I can easily lose track of these things, so having it in one place should help.
* I also need to establish a daily rhythm/routine for this jobhunt so that I'm staying focussed and give myself the best chance of success.
* I have a review tomorrow, so attending the process review workshop should give me a sharpener on coding skills. Especially as I have written in Ruby :gem: for a couple of weeks now. Here's hoping it comes flooding back ðŸ¤ž
* I missed meditation with Dana, which annoyed me a bit as it's good to hear her mini talks about open and focussed attention. Also at the start she asks the older cohorts what advice they'd share with their day one self and I wanted to share some advice about taking time to reflect each day about what you've learnt (which would be hypocritical as it's something I didn't manage, but if anyone else there started doing it, it would be hugely beneficial).

##### Setting expectations for the jobhunt

At the start of the course I had a good habit of setting daily goals but didn't do this towards the end of the course as the syllabus became less structured/prescribed and I think my learning suffered as a result. I still learnt, but it wasn't as focussed or as deep as it could have been. Daily goals should correct that and keeping track of whether I've achieved them or not on here should keep me honest.
Putting exercise and meditation on there reminds me to look after my general wellbeing too.
